# Embedding Meaning Algebra into Distributional Semantics

This repository contains the implementations for the work Embedding Meaning Algebra into
Distributional Semantics.

## Abstract
The field of distributional semantics has seen significant progress in recent years due
to advancements in natural language processing techniques, particularly through the
development of Neural Language Models like GPT and BERT. However, there are still
challenges to overcome in terms of semantic representation, particularly in the lack of
coherence and consistency in existing representation systems.
This work introduces a framework defining the relationship between a probabilistic
space, a set of meanings, and a vector space of static embedding representations; and
establishes formal properties based on definitions that would be desirable for any distri-
butional representation system to comply with in order to establish a common ground
between distributional semantics and other approaches. This work also introduces an
evaluation benchmark, defined on the basis of the formal properties introduced, which
will allow to measure the quality of a representation system.
